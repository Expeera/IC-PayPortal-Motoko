## Design and Implement the core functions.

- ### Create New Invoice:
    This `create_invoice` function enables users to create a new invoice by providing essential information such as the caller, amount, and payment gateway. It ensures the validity of the input data through various checks before proceeding with invoice creation. By leveraging the Service.Stripe.create_session function, it establishes a payment session with Stripe, a popular payment service provider. Upon successful session creation, the function increments the invoice number, stores the invoice details in a trie data structure, and updates the owner's list of invoices. The function concludes by returning a response that appropriately communicates the outcome of the invoice creation process, indicating whether it was successful or encountered any errors. This allows users to track and process payments using the unique invoice ID generated during the creation process.

- ### Change Invoice Status:
    The `change_invoice_status` function allows authorized users to modify the status of an invoice within an invoice management system. It validates caller authorization, payment method, and invoice existence. The function retrieves invoice and payment information from external services and handles different status scenarios. It updates the invoice status and generates appropriate responses indicating the outcome of the status change. Overall, it showcases the system's flexibility, security measures, integration capabilities, and efficient handling of invoice status modifications.

- ### Get My Invoices:
    The `get_my_invoices` function is a query function that allows a caller to retrieve their own invoices from the invoice management system. It first retrieves the list of invoice numbers associated with the caller from the ownerInvoicesTrie. Then, it iterates through the list of invoice numbers, retrieves the corresponding invoice details from the invoicesTrie, and constructs an array of invoices. The function returns this array as the result, providing the caller with their invoices. It provides a convenient way for users to access and view their invoice information within the system.

- ### Get All Invoices to Admin:
    The `get_all_invoices_to_admin` function allows the admin user to retrieve all invoices stored in the system. By returning an array of invoices, it provides the admin with easy access to the complete list of invoices. This function is designed to assist administrators in efficiently managing and reviewing invoices for administrative purposes. It enables them to retrieve and view all invoices in a straightforward manner, streamlining their workflow and facilitating effective invoice management.

- ### Change Invoice Status to Admin:
    The `change_invoice_status_to_admin` function enables the owner or administrator to modify the status of an invoice under certain conditions. This function is useful for updating the status of invoices based on administrative actions or special circumstances. The function ensures that the caller is authorized to make changes and validates the payment method provided in the request. If the conditions are met, the function updates the invoice status in the system, allowing administrators to efficiently manage and track the status of invoices.

- ### Is Owner: 
    The `is_owner` function checks if the caller is the owner of a resource. It compares the caller's identity with the owner's identity and returns a Boolean indicating the result. It is used for ownership verification in access control and authorization scenarios.

- ### Background Processing of Pending Invoices:
    The invoicing system employs a background processing mechanism to efficiently manage pending invoices. The `check_pending_invoices` function, complemented by the `heartbeat` system function, plays a pivotal role in automatically processing invoices that have been in the "Pending" status for an extended period. By periodically checking pending invoices and updating their status to "Cancelled By System" when the 24-hour threshold is exceeded, the system ensures efficient self-regulation. The `heartbeat` function schedules regular checks, maintaining data accuracy and enhancing overall efficiency. Together, these components provide seamless invoice management for administrators and users, safeguarding the integrity of the invoicing system.

### 6. Invoice Count:

```motoko
invoice_count: () : Nat
```

The `invoice_count` function is a query that takes no input parameters and returns a single natural number (nat). This function is designed to retrieve the total count of invoices in the system. It provides a convenient way for users or administrators to obtain the current number of invoices present, assisting in various statistical analyses or monitoring the growth of invoices over time. For implementation details, refer to the actual code and any accompanying documentation, which may include optimizations and other relevant information.

### 7. Set Owner:

```motoko
setOwner(newOwner : Text) : async Http.Response<Http.ResponseStatus<Bool, {}>>
```

The `setOwner` function is designed to change the owner of a canister within the system. It is a public and shared asynchronous function, meaning it can be called externally and supports inter-canister calls. This function takes a single parameter, newOwner, which is a Text value representing the new owner's identifier, and returns a response indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### 8. Is Owner:

```motoko
is_owner: () : Bool
```

The `is_owner` query function is designed to check if the caller (current user) is the owner of the system or has administrator privileges. It takes no input parameters and returns a boolean value (bool).

This query is crucial for implementing access control and security measures within the system. By calling the isOwner query, users can verify their privileges to perform certain actions or access specific functionalities restricted to the owner or administrators only.
